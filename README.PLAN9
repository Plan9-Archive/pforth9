# This version of hugs2006 is only for Plan 9
# It was created by taking a set of installed Debian hugs libs
# and substituting them for the original source distribution
# and hacking around on the HUGSPATH in the options.h to make things load
# the makefile options config files are based on andrey's hugs.tgz on sources
# the HUGSPATH in options.h may need to be changed to make some libraries work
# lightly tested -mycroftiv
